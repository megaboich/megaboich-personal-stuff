<p><a href="https://github.com/logolang/logo-playground">Logo playground</a> is an online IDE for LOGO programming language with ability to write and execute programs directly in web browser. </p>
<p>LOGO was my first programming language which I learned when I was 10 years old, so I decided to create a decent own-made environment to fullfill my nostalgia and have some fun during the process. </p>
