<p>2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. You need to
move blocks in order to combine the same tiles. The goal is to
reach 2048 or a maximum you can.</p>
<p>This is just another implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048">2048 Game</a> initially written by Gabriele Cirulli.
Fun project to get my hands to work with some technologies.</p>
<p>Demo is deployed here: <a href="https://megaboich.github.io/2048/">https://megaboich.github.io/2048/</a>.</p>
